Labour Market Information
=============
The Asia Pacific Gateway Skills Table (APGST) is a non-profit, regional partnership between labour, business and education/ training institutions with a mission to ensure the Asia Pacific Gateway has enough people with the right skills and training to meet its needs.

APGST wants to develop a stand-alone site where users can access all current Labour Market Information (LMI) products. 

The website (lmionline.ca) will link back to the APGST main site (apgst.ca) and will be branded as APGST. The APGST main site will have an LMI page which will link to the new stand-alone site. HRWire.ca can also house the main summary products and link back to the stand-alone site if applicable.

# Goals
- Ensure that the LMI products are easy to find (by browse or search) and the site is easy to use
- Ensure that the LMI products are easy to download as PDFs


# Activities

- Easy to understand landing page to give the user an idea of what is inside and how to use it
- More than one entry point to browse for documents (e.g. top menu bar and click through home page)
- Ability to search by keyword(s)
- Ability for APGST staff to upload documents to site and to revise website in-house
- Ability to track document downloads with as much information as possible without requiring the user to
register or login (TBD)
